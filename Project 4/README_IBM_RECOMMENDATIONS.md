# IBM Watson Studio Recommendation System

**Udacity Data Science Nanodegree - Recommendation Systems Project**

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive recommendation system for the IBM Watson Studio platform, analyzing user interactions with articles to provide personalized recommendations. The system incorporates multiple recommendation approaches to handle different user scenarios and data availability.

## Dataset

- **45,993 user-article interactions** from IBM Watson Studio platform
- **5,149 unique users** engaging with content
- **714 unique articles** covering data science, AI, and ML topics
- **No explicit ratings** - recommendations based on implicit feedback (interactions)

## Recommendation Methods Implemented

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Comprehensive analysis of user behavior patterns
- Data quality assessment and missing value handling
- Statistical insights into user engagement and article popularity

### 2. **Rank-Based Recommendations**
- Recommends most popular articles based on interaction frequency
- Ideal for new users with no interaction history
- Provides reliable baseline recommendations

### 3. **User-User Collaborative Filtering**
- Finds similar users based on interaction patterns using cosine similarity
- Recommends articles liked by similar users
- Handles personalization for users with sufficient interaction history

### 4. **Content-Based Recommendations**
- Uses NLP techniques (TF-IDF, K-means clustering) on article titles
- Groups articles by content similarity
- Recommends articles similar to those a user has already engaged with

### 5. **Matrix Factorization (SVD)**
- Applies Singular Value Decomposition to the user-item matrix
- Identifies latent factors in user preferences and article characteristics
- Provides sophisticated personalization for active users

## Technical Implementation

### Key Technologies
- **Python 3.12** with scientific computing stack
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** for text processing
- **K-means Clustering** for content grouping
- **SVD (Truncated)** for matrix factorization

### Architecture Highlights
- **Modular Design**: Each recommendation method implemented as separate functions
- **Pipeline Integration**: Functions work together for hybrid recommendations
- **Scalable Processing**: Efficient handling of sparse user-item matrices
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All functions validated against project test suite

## Key Functions Implemented

### Data Processing
- `create_user_item_matrix()` - Creates binary interaction matrix
- `get_article_names()` - Maps article IDs to titles
- `get_user_articles()` - Retrieves user interaction history

### Recommendation Engines
- `get_top_articles()` - Rank-based recommendations
- `find_similar_users()` - User similarity computation
- `user_user_recs()` - Collaborative filtering recommendations
- `make_content_recs()` - Content-based recommendations
- `get_svd_similar_article_ids()` - Matrix factorization recommendations

### Advanced Features
- `get_top_sorted_users()` - Improved user similarity with interaction weighting
- `user_user_recs_part2()` - Enhanced collaborative filtering with popularity ranking
- Content clustering with optimal cluster selection (50 clusters)
- SVD with 200 latent features for optimal performance

## Performance Metrics

### Data Insights
- **Median user interactions**: 3 articles
- **Most active user**: 364 interactions
- **Most popular article**: 937 interactions (ID: 1429)
- **User distribution**: Highly skewed with most users having few interactions

### Model Performance
- **SVD Accuracy**: ~85-90% on user-item prediction task
- **Content Clustering**: 50 clusters with 60.8% explained variance
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Effective similarity detection using cosine similarity

## Recommendation Strategy

### User Segmentation Approach
1. **New Users (0 interactions)**: Rank-based popular articles
2. **Light Users (1-5 interactions)**: Combination of rank-based + content-based
3. **Regular Users (5-20 interactions)**: User-user collaborative filtering
4. **Power Users (20+ interactions)**: Matrix factorization for advanced personalization

### Hybrid System Benefits
- **Coverage**: Handles all user types and scenarios
- **Quality**: Multiple methods provide diverse, high-quality recommendations
- **Scalability**: Efficient algorithms handle large-scale data
- **Robustness**: Fallback methods ensure system reliability
