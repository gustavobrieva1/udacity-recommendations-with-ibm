# IBM Watson Studio Recommendation System

**Udacity Data Science Nanodegree - Recommendation Systems Project**

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive recommendation system for the IBM Watson Studio platform, analyzing user interactions with articles to provide personalized recommendations. The system incorporates multiple recommendation approaches to handle different user scenarios and data availability.

## Files in This Project

- `Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb` - Main project notebook with complete analysis and implementations
- `data/user-item-interactions.csv` - Dataset containing user-article interactions
- `project_tests.py` - Test suite to validate all implemented functions
- `top_5.p`, `top_10.p`, `top_20.p` - Reference files for testing recommendations
- `README_IBM_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Detailed technical documentation

## Dataset

- **45,993 user-article interactions** from IBM Watson Studio platform
- **5,149 unique users** engaging with content  
- **714 unique articles** covering data science, AI, and ML topics
- **No explicit ratings** - recommendations based on implicit feedback (interactions)

## Recommendation Methods Implemented

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Comprehensive analysis of user behavior patterns
- Data quality assessment and missing value handling
- Statistical insights into user engagement and article popularity

### 2. Rank-Based Recommendations
- Recommends most popular articles based on interaction frequency
- Ideal for new users with no interaction history
- Provides reliable baseline recommendations

### 3. User-User Collaborative Filtering
- Finds similar users based on interaction patterns using cosine similarity
- Recommends articles liked by similar users
- Handles personalization for users with sufficient interaction history

### 4. Content-Based Recommendations  
- Uses NLP techniques (TF-IDF, K-means clustering) on article titles
- Groups articles by content similarity
- Recommends articles similar to those a user has already engaged with

### 5. Matrix Factorization (SVD)
- Applies Singular Value Decomposition to the user-item matrix
- Identifies latent factors in user preferences and article characteristics
- Provides sophisticated personalization for active users

## Technical Requirements Satisfied

âœ… **All Udacity Project Requirements Met:**
- Code functionality with comprehensive testing
- Thorough data exploration and visualization  
- Complete rank-based recommendation system
- Full collaborative filtering implementation
- Content-based recommendations with NLP
- Matrix factorization using SVD
- Detailed analysis and evaluation

## How to Run

1. Open `Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells sequentially from top to bottom
3. All functions are tested automatically via `project_tests.py`
4. Results include recommendations for different user types

## Key Results

- Successfully handles all user segments from new to power users
- Hybrid approach combines multiple recommendation methods
- High accuracy SVD model with 200 latent features
- Content clustering with 50 optimal clusters
- Comprehensive evaluation framework ready for A/B testing

---

**Ready for Production**: This recommendation system successfully addresses the IBM Watson Studio use case with robust, scalable, and effective recommendations for all user segments.
