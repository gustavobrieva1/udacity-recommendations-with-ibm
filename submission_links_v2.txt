UDACITY DATA SCIENCE PROJECT SUBMISSION CHECKLIST
===============================================

Before you submit:

Your project needs to Meet Specifications in all categories of the Project Rubric in order to pass. So before you submit, do a self-assessment of your work using the rubric, and you'll probably find some revisions you want to make first.

All you need to submit for this project are two links - one for your GitHub repo and one for your blog post. Your GitHub repo should contain your code, dataset, and README.md files.

You can either submit these links in the text input, or you can create a PDF document containing these links and upload it.

Make sure that your repo and blog post are publicly visible. We are unable to grade submissions that are not publicly visible!
